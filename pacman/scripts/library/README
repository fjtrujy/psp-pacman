human_to_size.sh:
A function to convert human readable sizes (such as "5.3 GiB") to raw byte
equivalents. base10 and base2 suffixes are supported, case sensitively. If
successful, the converted byte value is written to stdout and the function
returns 0. If an error occurs, nothing is written and the function returns 1.
Results may be inaccurate when using a broken implementation of awk, such
as mawk or busybox awk.
